Hi guys, 

Firstly thank you very much that you decided to register for our event.

I'm sending you what you need to participate in the event. Please prepare everything before you come. If you have any problems please don't hesitate to contact me. I will be 1 hour before our meeting at the office available so I could help you also from here.
Unfortunately we won't waste time for set up environments if you come unprepared :P 

We will play around with Docker or heroku with MongoDB.  Please use Linux!! I'm not familiar with Windows and I hope you are also Linux fan (or you become one;) Of course you can do everything with Windows but my support will be limited.

# 1. Register or use your Amazon account

[Please register at amazon developer portal ](http://developer.amazon.com/)
It is free of charge. (if you have ever bought something from Amazon you can use your current account;) **Without developer console you won't be able to test your skill** 


# 2. Download my Virtual Machine

Download and start my VM with Virtualbox. When you start my VM  everything is going to be opened for you. No work from your side!

My VM has scripts that the template can be updated anytime from here!! You don't need to clone this repository by yourself

       
[**Link to the VM:**](http://soon)

[**Link to the VirtualBox:**](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

PS: Please be sure you have installed VirtualBox!
